<h1>Justice For Every Student in KIIT</h1>

man, what's happening? what is even going on in my country? 

A student commits suicide after continuous physical and mental harassment from her ex-boyfriend, she even told the college authorities about her condition a month before taking this step but they just ignored her plea...

Her fellow college mates tries to protest and demand justice...

College authorities brings goons and 100s of policemen to restrain the students in their hostel room, beats them, <del>asks</del> forces the protesting students to leave the hostel...

The girl who lost her life was an International Student from Nepal. After the Nepal embassy decided to inspect the situation, the college tries to call the students back and they are pretending as if they left on their own. 

The accused tries to run away (he had a ticket <del>to</del> from Bhubaneshwar to Kolkata) but was stopped and is under-arrest right now. Well, I don't think justice will be served easily because apparently, the boy's father is rich and a lawyer as well. Rich and a lawyer?? Yea, good luck getting justice

While all this is happening the big national media houses are focusing on the Youtube joke controversy.

Check out this thread on X for <a href="https://x.com/BalanceinBias/status/1891254374191526087?t=LTvGHUoBNJCSL53YXXOSlQ&s=19">more details, videos, and audio recordings for ground reality.</a>

I wish all these people involved from the CEO of KIIT, to hostel staff, to policemen and security guards gets punished for this horrible incident. I know some of them were probably just following orders of authorities perhaps they were threatned for their life or lives of their families or perhaps offered money because it's the rich and powerful people we are taking about. Or perhaps all those involved have no moral sense or values to abide by.

I hope that justice is served to all the students who were affected by the cruelty of the authorities.

There are students saying that it wasn't even a suicide!! There are student witnesses who say they saw the authorities move the dead body of the victim student from the central library to the hostel room. The authorities are framing it as a suicide but Prakriti (the victim) died from sexual harrassment by Advik (the accused) in the central library itself.
