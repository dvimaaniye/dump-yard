i fucking hate being around stupid self-eccentric people, everything sucks, I'm so irrtitable and miserable these days idk wtf happened, one thing after the another sucked the joy and fun out of my life. I was in a phase where I was happy, not-toxic (okay slightly toxic still), but it was light hearted, I didn't had an attitude. but people I hate people and more than people I hate stupid people because they have the arrogance of a king and the brain of a jellyfish (Oo but jellyfish don't have brains, yea).

(and people, stop living in your fucking bubble, real world matters and what happens in the real world matters. not everything is "chalta hai" and not everything is about you in your little stupid bubble.)

why is everyone making fun of me? wtf it seems like everyone's fucking making fun of me. well not all the time but seems like every time they get to meet me they do. not the jokes and fun between friends but sometimes idk maybe are people actually laughing at me? my mind is not clear everything looks hazzy. I'm so irritated and angry my mind is stuck on one thing and having to live with that sucky thing in my mind kind of kills every moment every day. I'm running impatient about little things, idk how I went from phase chill to phase miserable to chill to miserable, the 2nd chill was the best I was at peace with everything, even stupid people and their stupidity, but the stubbornness of those stupid people of sticking with their stupid ideas even after a debate and discussion irritated me a lot. i was stupid to think that I can talk them out of some of their stupid believes or thoughts or whatever and however small but all it did to me is drove me crazy.

i hate being a double edged sword, I hate lying and lying people, but lately in this miserable phase I have lied a little somewhere about small things thinking it wouldn't matter but it makes me so sad. i just don't like it, I don't like the fact that i just couldn't tell them the truth because the truth might upset them but words don't go back, once they come out, they are out; so I just let them be. I try not to pile up on those + I really can't because I'm not really a good instantaneous liar I am not so creative but with some work and time I can come up with something but again I don't like to do that. HATE IT! I FUCKING HATE IT!

One thing after the other and the joy was sucked out and the white dove in my head was shot dead and in all this I fucking hate kids (unless they are mine i guess). little babies are fine they are innocent lives but once they are 2-3yrs old, hate them, I hate them. 

Just ignore this blog, this is just the anger speaking, I'm just clearing out my head. Putting this at the end and not the start because I also hate prefacing what I say.
